# Car Analysis

This project involves analyzing car-related data using Power BI to uncover key insights and trends. The dashboard includes dynamic filters, slicers, and advanced features like conditional formatting, tooltips, and interactive buttons for seamless navigation. Key insights include average car prices, fuel efficiency trends, and sales distribution across brands and transmission types. The project demonstrates data processing, visualization, and design skills, creating an engaging and informative single-page dashboard.

Data Transformation And Processing

1. Cleaning:
       o	Removed inconsistencies and ensured uniform data formatting (e.g., converted prices to a consistent currency, handled missing values).

2.	Calculated Columns and Measures:
       o	Created metrics like Average Mileage, Average Price, and Average Tax for summarized insights.
       o	Derived additional columns for comparisons (e.g., Price per MPG).


Key features and insights

Charts and Their Purpose

1.	KPIs:
        o	Average Mileage: Showcases the overall fuel efficiency trend (25.50K).
        o	Average Price: Displays the mean cost of vehicles ($22.7K), aiding pricing strategy analysis.
        o	Average Tax: Provides the average tax cost, highlighting fiscal trends.

2.	Pie Chart:
         o	Average Mileage by Fuel Type: Visualizes how mileage differs across fuel types (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric, etc.).
         o	This chart allows quick identification of fuel efficiency leaders (eg. Hybrid vehicles with 44.76K miles).

3.	Area Chart:
         o	Average Price by Fuel Type: Demonstrates price variations across fuel categories. For instance, Hybrid cars are pricier ($27.2K) compared to Electric ($18.2K).

4.	Bar Chart:
        o	Model by Transmission: Highlights popularity across transmission types (Semi-Auto, Automatic, Manual).

5.	Icons and Filters:
       o	Brand logos (e.g., BMW, Toyota) act as slicers for intuitive brand-specific filtering.
       o	Dropdown filters for Year, Model, Transmission, and Fuel Type enhance interactivity


Single-Page Layout Design

1.	Compact Visualization:
        o	Used strategic placements for KPIs at the top for immediate visibility.
        o	Placed interactivity tools (brand logos and dropdowns) on the left side for user-friendly navigation.

2.	Design Aesthetics:
        o	Incorporated a high-resolution image of a car as a backdrop to maintain visual appeal.
        o	Used appropriate spacing to avoid clutter while maintaining a comprehensive view of the data.

3.	Interactive Elements:
        o	Slicers and logos dynamically update all visuals, making the dashboard adaptable to specific user queries.
        o	Tooltips provide detailed insights without overwhelming the main visuals.

4.	Efficient Space Usage:
        o	Combined multiple related metrics into compact visuals (e.g., area chart and bar chart below the KPIs).

Advanced Features

1.	Conditional Formatting:
         o	Applied to highlight important values (e.g., highest mileage or lowest prices).

2.	Dynamic Titles:
         o	Dashboard titles update based on slicer selections, ensuring users are contextually aware of their data view.

3.	Bookmarks:
         o	Enabled quick navigation to different filtered states.

4.	Custom Icons and Design:
         o	Leveraged custom brand logos for slicers to improve usability and branding alignment

 5. 1.	Navigation Buttons:
         o	Purpose: Allow users to switch seamlessly between different views or pages within the report, making it easier to explore specific data categories (eg.brand comparison, fuel efficiency analysis).

         o	Implementation: Each button is linked to a bookmark, which saves the layout and filters applied to a specific view of the dashboard. Clicking a button triggers a switch to that bookmarked state.

3.	Brand Selection Buttons:
o	Purpose: Serve as slicers for quick filtering of data based on selected car brands (e.g., BMW, Toyota). These buttons update all visuals dynamically to show brand-specific insights.
o	Design: Custom brand logos are used for intuitive filtering and better aesthetics
